📘 DSA Repository

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implementations organized by programming language using a clean and scalable branch-based workflow.

🌿 Branch Structure
🔹 DsaAll (Parent Branch)

Main integration branch

Contains merged and finalized DSA solutions

Receives updates from all language-specific branches

🔹 DsaJs (Child Branch)

Holds DSA implementations written only in JavaScript

Used for development and testing of JS-based solutions

🔹 DsaPython (Child Branch)

Holds DSA implementations written only in Python

Used for development and testing of Python-based solutions

🔀 Development Workflow

Write and test DSA solutions in the respective language branch:

JavaScript → DsaJs

Python → DsaPython

Once stable, merge the child branch into the parent branch:

DsaJs → DsaAll

DsaPython → DsaAll

The DsaAll branch always represents the combined and updated DSA implementations.

🎯 Goals of This Repository

Maintain a clear separation of language-specific code

Enable clean and organized collaboration

Provide a scalable structure for adding more programming languages in the future

🚀 Future Enhancements

Add more languages (Java, C++, etc.)

Improve problem categorization (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP)

Add complexity analysis and explanations
