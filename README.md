📘 DSA Repository

I created this repository to practice and maintain Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in an organized way.
The code is separated by programming language using a clean branch-based structure, which makes it easy to manage and scale.

🌿 Branch Structure
🔹 DsaAll (Parent Branch)

This is the main branch

It contains the final and merged DSA solutions

All language-specific branches are merged here

🔹 DsaJs (Child Branch)

Contains DSA implementations written only in JavaScript

Used for writing and testing JS solutions

🔹 DsaPython (Child Branch)

Contains DSA implementations written only in Python

Used for writing and testing Python solutions

🔀 Development Workflow

I write and test DSA code in the respective language branch

JavaScript → DsaJs

Python → DsaPython

After the code is stable, I merge it into the parent branch

DsaJs → DsaAll

DsaPython → DsaAll

The DsaAll branch always contains the latest combined solutions

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Keep language-specific code clearly separated

Maintain a clean and structured DSA practice repo

Make it easy to add more languages in the future

🚀 Future Plans

Add more languages like Java and C++

Organize problems by topics (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, DP, etc.)

Add time and space complexity with explanations
